# About me üìù

- I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's in Computer Science from CU Boulder, specializing in Natural Language Processing for low-resource languages.
- My recent work at Cambium Assessment involves engineering end-to-end data processing pipelines for linguistic analysis.
- I have hands-on experience developing and evaluating neuro-symbolic models, including GNNs and LLM-based systems, to tackle complex problems like food hazard detection and semantic representation.
- I am passionate about building robust, fair, and typologically-informed models and am currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills in ML/NLP and MLOps.

# More (about me)

I‚Äôm Karthik Sairam, a recent graduate of the research-based Master's in Computer Science program at CU Boulder. My research focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing to enhance the accessibility of education in low-resource languages. During my time at CU, I also had the honor of serving as the President of [AAEIO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aaeio-cu-boulder/mycompany/) (American Association of Engineers of Indian Origin), where I worked to provide professional development opportunities for students from the South Asian community. When I‚Äôm not working, I love going on hikes, meditating, and playing the classical violin, which I've studied for almost 12 years.
