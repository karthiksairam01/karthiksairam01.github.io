# About me üìù

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's in Computer Science from CU Boulder, where I specialized in building and deploying advanced NLP and MLOps systems. My work focuses on the intersection of **Neuro-Symbolic AI**, **Conversational AI**, and **Graph-based Analysis**. I'm passionate about transforming unstructured conversational data into explainable models that can reveal complex dynamics like persuasion and intent.

Recently, I've been focused on developing **agentic RAG systems**. My latest project is an AI Research Assistant that can autonomously reason and synthesize information across multiple research papers to answer complex, comparative questions. I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills to build robust, scalable, and impactful AI-driven solutions.


# More (about me)

I‚Äôm Karthik Sairam, a recent graduate of the research-based Master's in Computer Science program at CU Boulder. My research focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing to enhance the accessibility of education in low-resource languages. During my time at CU, I also had the honor of serving as the President of [AAEIO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aaeio-cu-boulder/mycompany/) (American Association of Engineers of Indian Origin), where I worked to provide professional development opportunities for students from the South Asian community. When I‚Äôm not working, I love going on hikes, meditating, and playing the classical violin, which I've studied for almost 12 years.
