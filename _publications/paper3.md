Kannada is a South-Indian Dravidian language that has quite a complex vocabulary and grammar. This urges researchers in the NLP domain to broaden the research horizons for these low-resourced languages in the hopes of developing revolutionary tools in these languages to enable the speakers of this low-resourced language to communicate with the world and with technology. Paraphrase generation can help simplify complex concepts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. Furthermore, paraphrase generation can help improve language comprehension and retention among language learners. Paraphrase generation can also aid in language translation, which can help translators accurately convey the meaning of the source text in the target language while ensuring that the translated text is natural and flows well.
