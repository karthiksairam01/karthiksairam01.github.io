This project is a web application that allows users to have a conversation with one of my NLP research papers. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide accurate, context-aware answers based solely on the content of the document, effectively preventing the language model from hallucinating.

The application was built to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow, from data processing and creating a vector store with ChromaDB to building an interactive user interface with Streamlit and deploying a conversational AI powered by Google's Gemini model.
